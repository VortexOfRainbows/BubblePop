Bubble Developer Log (Vortex)

Maybe Do:
1. Organize layers better for rendering, so player and enemies can be in front of stuff like trees, chests, etc. But also can be behind them depending on y position...
2. Day/Night system (so we can have cooler lighting)
3. Wave bar on the top shows current wave card modifier information
4. Integrate Compendium into the pause menu
5. Grass shader to make grass more interesting and potentially slightly vary in the wind

Need to do:
1. Unlock system might need more reworks in the future (hide far away unlocks, only directly showing character unlocks unless the character has already been unlocked, in which case their equipment can be shown too. Example: if you don't have thought bubble unlocked, the thought bubble-related unlocks are hidden entirely)
	1. Achievement chains, to hide achievements that are currently unobtainable
	2. Hide unlocks from char select until they are unlocked, including subequipments
	3. Progress display for achievements
2. More descriptive pause and select screen (pause screen should show powerups and change powerups default display to right side vertical)
3. Make a distinct "Generic Power" pool, which contains: 
	1. Economy: Magnet, Discount, Bonus Shop Stock per reroll/restock, More Gem Drops Per Round, Midas Touch (gold is worth more)
4. Add a GEM currency, which can be used to reroll shop selections
5. Add descriptions for character abilities on a sidebar and each equipments contribution to the ability pool
6. Alternate book: Introduction to Electromagnetism (has a slower closing speed and damage, but drags powerups with it)
7. Rework character equipment origins to allow more specific adjustments per character (such as giving thought bubble body slots lower than other character body slots)
8. Make power display on the bottom smaller
9. Gacha slots need a debuff instead of dropping coins outright (and for tokens too! As this would fix the problem where it competes for real-estate with chips, and would allow players to more freely use the slot machine on enemies that survive a hit of the melee!)
10. Make enemies spawn further away when possible, slower coming out of the portal
11. New tile variation system + tile resprite implementation
12. Make it so enemies become permanent at a cheaper price from wave cards
13. Fix issue where Pylons unpurify when far away from the player (like after a few waves); not sure why this happens

Less Important (mostly non-issues or complete already), but in consideration:
1. Fix resolution scaling issues across the board, such as with the compendium and tier list
2. Improve UI
3. Maybe shift roadblock visuals to the player so it's more encompassing
4. Right now nodes can not spawn next to identical nodes, due to how the position of the prefab is shifted to paste them like a stamp
5. Enemy Pathfinding
6. Make it so you can't start an attack from a click hovering over User Interface elements that need to be clicked to interact
	1. To help with the thought bubble achievement now that there are more elements to be clicked

Current Task List:
1. Quest List UI that says stuff like:
	1. Activate the First Pylon => Clear 2 Waves of Invaders => Stabilize the Pylon => Activate the Next Pylon
2. Finish Pylon and Roadblock systems:
	1. Pointers that show you the direction to the next Pylon
3. Multiplayer:
	1. Make both players share powers (for now)
		1. Global power effects should be moved to a separate class and given special logic to prevent stacking effects, as both players will actually have a cloned power pool for now (global effects will also likely still be global when making online multiplayer, so it will work there too (though this is hardly important for a long time))
	2. Method for targeting the closest player (enemies, coins, etc.)
	3. Controls for the separate player (try some special keyboard inputs for now, controller later)

14. Add EUREKA, a new power for the Light Bulb hat, aiding in gem mechanics
15. Unlocking Thought Bubble now requires wave 25 -> 20
16. Unlocking Gachapon now requires coins 6480 -> 5000
17. Some worldgen adjustments to padding and color of minor decor on the outer border to match the multiplier on the outer border
18. Fix issue where character and equipment orientation would start on the wrong side when facing left, standing still, and switching character or equipment


12/27/25 to 12/29/25
1. Procedurally Generated exterior to the map
	1. This will help in the future with making it easier to blend nodes, as they only need to implement a thin border while the rest of the exterior will be procedurally generated
2. Rework the way tiles are stored to make them easier to use internally
	1. However, the world generation speed should be somewhat increased (now using a dictionary instead of linear search)
3. Add Dragon Slots variant to Gacha Slots + unlock condition
4. Bubble Staff no longer adds coalescence to the pool. It now grants an additional charge shot levels and 20% increased secondary attack speed

12/25/25 (Christmas)
1. Resprite/Upscale:
	1. Grass Tile
	2. Flower Texture
2. Add 1 new flower and tall grass variant that can spawn on grass for extra variation
3. Add 2 new grass tile variants to vary the grass in terrain

12/24/25 (Almost Christmas!)
1. Bug where characters would sometimes wear other character's as equipment, preventing you from switching from character in the hat slot, should be fixed
2. Pierce from Big Bubble is no longer truncated (now decimal damage)
	1. Technically this is a minor buff
3. While falling, chests now have collision, but less mass
	1. After landing, their mass will return to normal
4. Big Bubble Projectile now bounces off walls in a more physically correct manner, and gains 10% velocity instead of losing 25% velocity
5. Token pouch max tokens 3 (+3) -> 2 (+2), tokens per wave 2 (+2) -> 1 (+1)
	1. now player starts with 4 max token slots
6. Add Pirate's Booty Power
7. WIP Node stuff (add Node Snap Parent for snapping decor to correct spots on the axis)

12/22/25 to 12/23/25
1. WIP Node Generation:
	1. Now the primary arena is generated with a NODE
	2. While the whole system is far from complete, this is a great start!
2. Rework how tile data is stored and generated for cleaner folder organization
3. Change some sound effects for Batter Up
4. Change some power descriptions and names
5. Reduce base damage of Gacha Slot non-winning spin 5 -> 4
6. Gacha Slots projectiles now lose more damage when piercing then before (-20%, -15%, -10%, -5%) -> (-20%, -20%, -20%, -20%)
7. Rework how the world is generally created and collision loaded (from a floor map and a wall map to a composite map). Should result in slightly less memory usage (maybe), and potentially improved performance
	1. The main benefit is the internal and development organization is greatly improved, as only one tile map in a node needs to be modified
	2. Also some visual artifacts should be removed as a result of this change
8. Remove TilesThatCountForBlending system due to it seeming obsolete, which will change how tiles look slightly
9. Thunder bubble no longer increases in speed by 10% when it bounces off of walls
10. Added a new grass tile that matches with the border color (for secret ways)

1. Bubble Gun and Light Bulb no longer contribute Haste to the Pool
2. Bubble Gun no longer contributes another Bubble Propulsion to the Pool
3. Gachapon now generates chips even before waves have started
4. Begin work on Gacha Slots
	1. Now has a functional animation + functional right click animation + death animation
	2. The Left-Click mechanics are mostly done, but it SERIOUSLY needs balancing... lol
	3. Now has an equip animation (just rolls to jackpot)
	4. Powers: Consolation Prize, Pity, Token Pouch, Bogo Spin, Roulette Wheel, Batter Up
	5. It does somewhat compete with Chips for enemy min-maxing when combined with Double Down (which should people prefer?)
5. Chests now come with some unique sounds! Kinda...
6. Increased power up prices across the board, for both wave rewards and the shop: (10 -> 15, 15 -> 25, 25 -> 50, 50 -> 100, 100 -> 250)
	1. Reduced rate of shop price inflation 10% -> 5%
7. Wave Start power rewards now have a lower cost multiplier 2 -> 1.5
8. Roll for Perception now caps the reduced weight of rarity 1 and 2 powers at 0.2 -> 0.5
	1. This means common items should no longer appear as infrequently with the power in high quantities

10. Slight modifications to Gachapon's Moving and Facial Animations
11. Fix issue where bunce hat would fly into the sky uncontrollably when switching from Gachapon to Bubblemancer in the equip menu where bunce hat was worn by Bubblemancer
12. Slots loss animation is now more random
13. Gachapon Chip recharge time 2.5 -> 3.0
	1. This is meant to be a slight nerf to push Chips towards being the emergency burst option they were designed for, rather than a primary weapon (yes this change is targeted to YOU. YOU know who YOU are...)

12/15/25
1. Import Weapon Assets for Gachapon Weapon!


-- A1.40 --


12/12/25 to 12/14/25

2. Fix some wave card scaling UI issues

12/11/25
1. Make it so all enemies are BLACKED until picked in a run, rather than unlocked.
2. Crystal ambient sound is now effected by your sound setting
	1. It should also no longer permanently play twice
3. Fix bug where Eternal Bubbles accidentally increased bubble range
4. Give Burger the damage up back (I accidentally removed it for some reason)
5. Fix bug where game reloaded large amounts of data upon restart
	1. This should generally improve loading times
6. Relationships between equipment prefabs is now defined internally and with an exact ordering
	1. Now it has a consistent ID system
	2. For future updates, this should fix the randomizing of previously equipped equips and tier list when new equips are added
7. Bunce hat unlock requirement reduced 20 -> 10


-- A1.35 --


11/30/25 to 12/1/25

2. Added DEBUG UI and Upgraded WAVE SKIP functionality to allow better* gameplay simulation
3. Fixed bug where enemy ui scaling updates were framerate dependent

		1. Coins: (10%, 20%, 30%) -> (25%, 37.5%, 50%)
		2. Hearts: (20%, 40%, 60%) -> (5%, 10%, 15%)
		3. Keys: (20%, 40%, 60%) -> (5%, 6.25%, 7.5%)
6. Increased cost and decreased appearance rate of higher tier chest rewards (costs go up by around 10%)
	1. Added a flat 40% chance to fail a chest upgrade, compounding for gem chests (meaning that even if they can be afforded, the chance is now 36% for them to appear compared to the other chests).
	2. Greatly decreased the average size of chest rewards by giving a 67% chance to fail a quantity increase roll
7. Increased cost of keys for purpose of director spawning by 20%, but rate of appearance increased by about 14%
	1. Keys now have a disadvantage roll for the quantity to spawn (it will roll twice and pick the lower spawn value)
8. Coupons now decreases shop prices by 10% -> 12% (this should realistically not improve the item whatsoever, but is funny)
9. Immediate Coin rewards point cost multiplier 2.0 -> 1.5, meaning coins are more plentiful in immediate wave rewards
	1. Coins spawned by wave rewards are now rounded to multiplies of 5
10. Fix bug where coins and keys were preserved on pressing the RESTART button

11/25/25
1. Movespeed augments now all receive a LOGARITHMIC (?) POST-PROCESSING curve, rather than just burger and cloudwalkers
2. Fix bug where chests would sometimes not stack in the reward menu


-- A1.30 --


11/24/25
1. Fix bug with Leonard soundtrack playing when it shouldn't (at least, this should be fixed, but not guaranteed)
2. Added Perpetual Bubble Machine to the Black Market Pool, seems to work OK
3. Chicken now appears in the first wave instead of the duck often
4. Duck, Flamingo, and Leonard movement AI adjusted to be somewhat more aggressive
5. Adjust bestiary a bit more: Crow card art changed, and hovering enemies only increases the enemy size rather than the size and bg size

11/21/25
1. Binary stars and sparkle-sparkle is no longer effected by bubble propulsion
2. Simplified movement logic on small bubbles:
	1. Remove slight anti-gravity on small bubbles

2. Leonard theme and pre-emptive music transition system...
3. Add alternate arts for the rock spider to add some variation
4. Modify duck movement to be more consistent and slightly aggressive

11/8/25
1. Fixed bug where savedata reset character unlocks on update :)


-- A1.25 --


11/6/25 to 11/7/25

10. Add Cloud Walkers, a movement speed increasing item (logarithmic)
11. Cap movement speed bonus at 0.1x-2.0x
12. Haste bonus 10% -> 7%, but is now available by default (it has NOT been removed from equips, though)


-- A1.20 --


11/3/25 to 11/6/25
1. Change Pause and Game Over UI objects to be shared.
2. Add settings to the pause menu
3. NPC displays now use live NPCs instead of static card art.
	1. NOTES (obsolete-ish): Fix enemies appearing over UI when the tier list is closed. Right now I'm disabling the box-individual mask, also for other reasons (it can't work how I want it to)...
		1. One way to do this is with a mask, if you can double layer masks.
