Dev Build 2.1 (tentative version number)

New:
1. Experimental Local Multiplayer
2. Add new Power: Shard of Glass
3. Add new sprite for Power: Roulette Wheel

Changes:
1. Removed Coalescence's hidden .01 seconds absorption scaling per stack 
2. Completely remove flamingo feather homing factor and leonard laser homing factor
3. Some experimental changes to UI (more to come in the future)
4. Powerups no longer use physics colliders for detecting if they can be picked up, potentially reducing lag

Misc:
1. Many internal reworks in order to allow multiplayer to work, which may cause some bugs

Fixes:
1. Fix bug where switching characters would briefly misorient equips (make them face a wrong direction)
2. Fix bug where slot machine would sometime cause an error when first used


Dev Build 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 (tentative version number)

New:
1. Enemy portals may now spawn near either player in multiplayer mode
2. After the initial enemy spawn adjustments, if the enemy spawn is STILL too close to the player(s), it now attempts to shift away from the player(s) (~36 attempts), while searching for valid tiles, which should hopefully curb enemies spawning on players in nearly all cases, including some where you are hiding inside a enclosed area
3. Batter up resprite
4. Gatligator resprite and appropriate hitbox modifications
	1. Now has animations for shooting, chomping
	2. Increased gun lock-on rate 0.02 -> 0.03
	3. Works with infector

Changes:
1. Add ~0.5 seconds of grace frames where enemies don't deal damage when first spawning in
2. Enemy wave card enemy cost scaling 10 -> 8, cost to make permanent 2.0x -> 1.75x
	1. This should make enemies more reliably become part of the enemy pool
3. Lowered volume multiplier on small bubble pop sound 70% -> 50%

Misc:
1. Coins now search for the closest player to be attracted to every 10 frames
2. Node Prefabs are now only loaded once on the first world generation, rather than on every world generation, improving restart speed slightly
3. Reworks to tiles for variation implementation

Fixes:
1. Fix bug where multiplayer UI screen did not appear (for real this time)
2. Crucible should now work for both players in multiplayer
3. Bubblebirb should now work in multiplayer
4. Slight changes to multiplayer camera + some bug fixes
5. Fix bubble gun secondary attack not working for multiplayer player 2
6. In multiplayer, health UI is only updated by player 1 now, which should reduce lag and fix some visual bugs
7. Fix bubble shield not working in multiplayer
8. In multiplayer, only player 1 will update the camera during the death animation, making it match singleplayer update speeds
