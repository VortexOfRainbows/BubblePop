Dev Build 1.40 (tentative version number)

New:
1. Character Select UI changes: as it stands now, this is generally just a small fidelity improvement, but more will come later!

Misc:
1. Make it so all enemies are BLACKED until picked in a run, rather than unlocked.
2. Relationships between equipment prefabs is now defined internally and with an exact ordering
	1. Now it has a consistent ID system
	2. For future updates, this should fix the randomizing of previously equipped equips and tier list when new equips are added

Fixes:
1. Crystal ambient sound is now effected by your sound setting
	1. It should also no longer permanently play twice
2. Fix bug where Eternal Bubbles accidentally increased bubble range
3. Fix bug where game reloaded large amounts of data upon restart
	1. This should generally improve loading times
4. Give Burger the damage up back (I accidentally removed it for some reason)
5. Fix some wave card scaling UI issues
