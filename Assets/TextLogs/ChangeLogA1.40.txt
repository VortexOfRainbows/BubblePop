Dev Build 1.40 (tentative version number)

New:
1. Character Select UI changes: as it stands now, this is generally just a small fidelity improvement, but more will come later!

Misc:
1. Make it so all enemies are BLACKED until picked in a run, rather than unlocked.
2. Relationships between equipment prefabs is now defined internally and with an exact ordering
	1. Now it has a consistent ID system
	2. For future updates, this should fix the randomizing of previously equipped equips and tier list when new equips are added

Fixes:
1. Crystal ambient sound is now effected by your sound setting
	1. It should also no longer permanently play twice
2. Fix bug where Eternal Bubbles accidentally increased bubble range
3. Fix bug where game reloaded large amounts of data upon restart
	1. This should generally improve loading times
4. Give Burger the damage up back (I accidentally removed it for some reason)
5. Fix some wave card scaling UI issues





Dev Build 1.50 (tentative version number)

New:
1. New Weapon: Gacha Slots, unlocked with Gachapon
	1. Comes with 7 accompanying powers, as well as some synergy with other powers
2. New sound for chest spawning in

Changes:
1. Bubble Gun no longer contributes Haste or Bubble Propulsion to the pool
2. Light Bulb no longer contributes Haste to the pool
3. Gachapon now generates chips slower (2.5 -> 3.0), but can generate them in char select
	1. This is meant to be a slight nerf to push Chips towards being the emergency burst option they were designed for, rather than a primary weapon (yes this change is targeted to YOU. YOU know who YOU are...)
4. Increased power up prices across the board, for both wave rewards and the shop: (10 -> 15, 15 -> 25, 25 -> 50, 50 -> 100, 100 -> 250)
	1. Reduced rate of shop price inflation 10% -> 5%
	2. This should make early game prices steeper, common powers will be cheaper later game
5. Wave Start power rewards now have a lower cost multiplier 2 -> 1.5 relative to Wave End reward
6. Roll for Perception now caps the reduced weight of rarity 1 and 2 powers at 0.2 -> 0.5
	1. This means common items should no longer appear as infrequently with the power in high quantities
7. When not seeking an implant (where their hitbox turns off anyways), Infectors now try to stay 3 -> 4 units away from the player

Misc:
1. Slight modifications to Gachapon's Moving and Facial Animations

Fixes:
1. Fix issue where bunce hat would fly into the sky uncontrollably when switching from Gachapon to Bubblemancer in the equip menu where bunce hat was worn by Bubblemancer
