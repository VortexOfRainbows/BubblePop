2. Heart consumables
3. Blue variants for Bubblemancer have new effects and slightly changed
4. Thought Bubble recall now zaps nearby enemies, scales with both TB trail abilities

Fix:
1. Enemies can no longer die multiple times at once, leading to possible many item and coin drops
2. Fixed bug where you could prematurely redraw cards
3. Fix bug where gachapon couldn't hold ability at some milestones in ability refresh speed (hopefully)
4. Attempt fixing bug where number display would sometimes not work in Equip or Achievement Menu
