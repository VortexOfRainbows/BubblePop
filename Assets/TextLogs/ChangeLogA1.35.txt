Dev Build 1.35 (tentative version number)

New:
1. Added DEBUG UI and Upgraded WAVE SKIP functionality to allow better* gameplay simulation

Balance:
1. Coins are now first priority for secondary chest loot, coins->hearts->keys, rather than hearts->keys->coin
	1. Additionally, the rates for the loot was changed like this:
		1. Coins: (10%, 20%, 30%) -> (25%, 37.5%, 50%)
		2. Hearts: (20%, 40%, 60%) -> (5%, 10%, 15%)
		3. Keys: (20%, 40%, 60%) -> (5%, 6.25%, 7.5%)
2. Increased cost and decreased appearance rate of higher tier chest rewards (costs go up by around 10%)
	1. Added a flat 40% chance to fail a chest upgrade, compounding for gem chests (meaning that even if they can be afforded, the chance is now 36% for them to appear compared to the other chests).
	2. Greatly decreased the average size of chest rewards by giving a 67% chance to fail a quantity increase roll
3. Increased cost of keys for purpose of director spawning by 20%, but rate of appearance increased by about 14%
	1. Keys now have a disadvantage roll for the quantity to spawn (it will roll twice and pick the lower spawn value)
4. Coupons now decreases shop prices by 10% -> 12% (this should realistically not improve the item whatsoever, but is funny)
5. Immediate Coin rewards point cost multiplier 2.0 -> 1.5, meaning coins are more plentiful in immediate wave rewards
	1. Coins spawned by wave rewards are now rounded to multiplies of 5

Fixes:
1. Streamlined some internal UI processes
2. Fixed bug where Enemy UI scaling updates was framerate dependent
3. Fixed bug where wave cards were selectable while in pause menu
4. Fix bug where coins and keys were preserved on pressing the RESTART button
