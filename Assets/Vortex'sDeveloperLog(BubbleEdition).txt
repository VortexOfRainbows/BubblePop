Vortex'sDeveloperLog(BubbleEdition)

Maybe Do:
1. Organize layers better for rendering
2. Add cloud particles
3. Quadrant system UI
4. Day/Night system (so we can have cooler lighting)
5. Wave bar on the top shows current wave card + modifier information

Need to do:
1. Improve UI and add UNLOCK SCREEN *** (maximum importance)
	1. Add descriptions for character abilities on a sidebar and each equipments contribution to the ability pool
2. Unlock system might need more reworks in the future (hide far away unlocks, only directly showing character unlocks unless the character has already been unlocked, in which case their equipment can be shown too)
3. More descriptive pause and select screen
4. Integrate Settings and compendium into the default pause stuff
5. Make calculator homing snappier
6. Integrate character select into the compendium
7. Enemy page on the compendium
8. Make a distinct "Generic Power" pool, which contains: Haste, Magnet, Choice, Mitosis, Overclock, and more...
	1. TBD: Strength...
9. Add Chests! These can spawn on the world naturally, be placed by designer, or spawned by wave rewards!
	1. Contains loot with higher chances of good loot based on the rarity of the chest
10. Add a GEM currency, which can be used to reroll choice selections or shop selections, and maybe open special chests (not saved between runs).
	1. This will replace the current drop rate of powers, since I want to reduce power drop-rate prevalancy
11. Indiana Jones Crystal Skull equip for Gachapon, which makes all waves have an additional skull: Unlock "Or Bust: Complete wave 15 whilst taking only 3-skull cards"

Ideas for Thunder Primary on Thought Bubble:
	1. Power up that increases their return damage (Barbed Lightning) (white)
	2. Power up that spawns bubble in the areas where the lightning was recalled from after a delay (Echo Bubbles?) (green)
	3. After killing 10 enemies, become a choice power with two additional options (Research Notes) (white or green)
	4. After killing 10 enemies, gain 25 coins +coins equal to the amount of powers you own (Research Grants) (white or green)
	5. Alternate book: Introduction to Electromagnetism (has a slower closing speed and damage, but drags powerups with it)

Mostly done but might need to keep an eye out:
1. Fix resolution scaling issues across the board, such as with the compendium and tier list

Done: 

9/1/25 to 9/2/25
1. Initial setup for enemies in the compendium
2. Static enemy data

8/31/25
1. A small amount of file/directory reorganization
2. Extremely basic flower spawning and ordering

8/27/25 and 8/29/25
1. Red bubblemancer variants refresh
	1. Also redid the effects to be simpler
2. Add Ent enemy, basically a tankier chicken that also explodes into bullets

8/25/25 to 8/27/25
1. Add skull ticks + animations to the pylon meter to show when associated card waves will be spawned.
2. Adjustments to the rate at enemies are spawned, the length of waves, and make it so enemies can only be spawned as part of associated cards during their first appearance, unless they are the first enemy in the deck (Ducks, right now).
3. Gachapon shop restocks a fair bit faster
4. Fix some more portal positioning issues
5. Some permanent scaling factors in the pylon card pool (health, credit scaling, skull wave scaling)
6. Some preset wave orders, such as designated Leonard waves.
7. Leonard no longer spawns ducks and base health decreased 80 -> 45 (This is to make up for the fact that SKULL enemies now exist (preliminary champion enemy)
8. Gatligator base health 40 -> 25
9. Adjust size and hitboxes of all enemies to make them more standardized for purpose of buff application and other additional ui elements
10. Skull Enemies (a champion variant of enemies spawned at wave checkpoints). They have 2x hp, 1.14x size, and a cool health bar!
11. Duck base health 12 -> 10, max coins 10 -> 8
12. Skull enemies must be killed before a wave properly ends
13. At the end of a wave, but before skull enemies are killed, indicators will show the general direction skull enemies are in (so they are easier to kill to end a wave)
14. Skull swarm modifier that multiplies enemies spawned during boss waves

8/18/25 to 8/25/25
1. Add Burger Powerup and black market powerup basics (right now very primitive system)
	1. Chance to be sold in the shop (~1/200) at a flat rate, at a different price

	3. Remove legacy wave-spawner (beyond obsolete)
	4. Add ability to pick wave-cards which effect the upcoming waves (missing: pause, associated ambush cards)
6. WIP UI reworks related to the director
	1. Remove SCORE and HIGHSCORE. Replaced with WAVE NUMBERS!
7. Some unlock requirement changes
8. Waves don't start again until the player manually starts them after a wave-end! (mouse or hotkey)
9. Some animations for the card deck + pause functionality works with the animations
10. EnemyCard/Director card locations are now generated on spawn rather than pre-emptively, mostly preventing situations where enemies spawn on top of you
11. Fix some wavecard locations being determined erroneously
12. Pylon cards now come with accompanying wave cards that are played at intervals during the round relative to the round completion percent
13. Fix bubbleshield interaction with new pylon system

8/13/25
1. Light spears only hit one enemy per spear now, no longer piercing enemies that are layered on top of each other
2. Basic compendium support for alternative descriptions (for powerups that have different effects on different characters)

8/12/25
1. Reduced spread and increased base velocity of Bubble Gun projectiles
2. Bubble gun art refresh by sam!

4. Light caster and spears do not break on tiles
5. Electroluminescence effect (probably the most powerful powerup yet...)
6. Add basic framework for spawning trails on objects

8/10/25
1. Bubblemancer Wand art refresh by sam + fixed some animation consistency with flipping
2. Change bubblemancer bubble color to be more in-line with new aesthetic

8/6/25 to 8/9/25
1. Compendium refactor and decoupling of tier list logic
2. Move haste and overclock to be back to their actual ID positions (order of implementation)
3. Move some data structures to main instead of character select, as it should be loaded immediately and consistent
4. Add Equipment/Character compendium
5. More advanced description capacity for equipment
6. Equipment rarities and additional sorting option (reverse)
7. Some reworks to Equipment data structure
8. Equipments now keep track of how often you have used them

7/30/25 to 8/1/25
1. Decimal damage added
2. Not sure I like it, but now there's 2 attacks on TB's book
3. Book death animation (swag)
4. Reduce I-frames granted to soap children 80 -> 45
5. Director now gains 2 * (wave num) bonus credits on rounds that are multiplies of 5, and swarm cards are only converted on rounds 25+ and only have a cost multiplier of 0 -> 0.5. This should keep those waves special, but make it not as luck based.
6. Slight nerfs to enemy scaling rates
7. Some more book animation changes and file reorganization
8. Snake eyes now increases damage of poison by stacking, rather than duration
	1. It may also deal the killing blow now

12. Flamingos now take 2.4 -> 3.0 seconds before the first shot, than now requires somewhere between 0.6 to 3.0 seconds -> 2.0 to 3.0 seconds to fire additional shots (overall nerf). Flamingo movement is not as random and is now weighted to travel towards the player. Flamingo feathers homing factor reduced by 50%.
13. Chance for luck-based item drops is reduced slightly for every power up spawned (at 300 powers, reduced to 10% of its usual rate)
	1. Does not effect lucky star, but spawns from Lucky Star and Shop are included in this decreasing multiplier

15. Reduce flat chance of Choice Powerup 20% -> 15% drop rate
16. Rework Coalescence into a considerably better powerup
	1. Not only is it incredibly powerful with great synergy, now it also reduced lag of certain end-game builds

7/21/25 to 7/24/25
1. Primitive enemy scaling factors (starts slow at 5% per wave, then 10%, then 5% plus 5% multiplicative, then 10% multiplicative
	1. Really needs playtesting to understand

7. Add the four gachapon dice powers
8. Sparkle sparkle scaling nerfed on gachapon + heuristic
9. Slight diminishing returns on eternal bubbles (at stack 10, its effect is dramatically reduced)
