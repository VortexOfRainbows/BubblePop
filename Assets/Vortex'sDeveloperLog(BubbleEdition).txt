Vortex'sDeveloperLog(BubbleEdition)

Need to do:

1. Projectile code improvement
	1. Immunity frame functionality improvements

2. Thought Bubble equipment
	1. Tail: Optimizations to be made: Instead of removing trails, just mark them as deleted. This will make preserving positions and stuff easier, and it will make it more consistent
	2. Tail: also needs better visuals (lightning), sound queues
	3. Tail: Maybe make camera follow the tail


3. More content (thought bubble weapon, power ups)

4. GameObject Request system (in order to somewhat replicate manual spritebatch)

5. Add cloud particles

5. Improve UI and add UNLOCK SCREEN

6. Outline Shader

7. Make characters show their currently selected equipment before equipping

Done:

3/1/25 to 3/5/25
1. Add bubble trail, coalescence, lucky star
2. Added Bubble Gun (may be slightly underpowered)
3. Coalescence only available on bubble staff (which no longer removes shotgun powers)
4. WIP Thought Bubble Trail

2/28/25
1. Character selection internal overhaul and allow support for subcategories
	1. Overall the code is vastly improved in terms of clarity and readability as well
2. Character should now probably save what was last equipped on them (like a loadout)

2/27/25
1. Small rework to the projectile class to make it better
2. WIP Saving what a character has selected

2/25/25 to 2/26/25
1. Light Bulb cosmetic + glow
2. Fix death animation centering (slight consistency improvements)
3. WIP Thought Bubble body and ability changes
4. Character colors
5. WIP Particle system reworking (right now figuring out how particle system works in Unity)

2/24/25
1. Added unlock condition to lab coat (temp) and changes some names
2. Improve audio system
3. Starbarb sound (marcos)
4. Fix bug where player sometimes wasn't getting IFrames after Bubble Birb
