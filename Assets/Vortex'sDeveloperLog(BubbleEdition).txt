Vortex'sDeveloperLog(BubbleEdition)

Need to do:

1. Projectile code improvement
	1. Immunity frame functionality improvements

2. Thought Bubble equipment
	1. Tail: also needs better visuals, sound cues
	2. Tail: Maybe make camera follow the tail while traveling down

3. More content (thought bubble weapon, power ups)

4. GameObject Request system (in order to somewhat replicate manual spritebatch)

5. Add cloud particles

5. Improve UI and add UNLOCK SCREEN *** (maximum importance)

6. Outline Shader

7. Unlock system might need more reworks in the future (hide far away unlocks, only directly showing character unlocks unless the character has already been unlocked, in which case their equipment can be shown too)

8. Separate Faces from the transform of the body so that they can act independently of it (try to fix the weird rotation bug with faces rn)

9. Rework the powerup icons for Weapon Upgrade and Ability Upgrade to be more standardized like the rest of the powers

Done:

2. Coins now collide with walls
3. Simplify UI and add money UI icon with some details
